# Introduction

This project was created with the purpose of studying the Entity Framework Core. It was inspired by the tutorial on this link https://docs.microsoft.com/pt-br/ef/core/get-started/?tabs=netcore-cli.<br>
The **MCHomem.Blogging.ConsoleApp** project is a console interface through which it is possible to interact with the database.
The solution includes other projects, in general I divide the MVC responsibilities into separate projects.

# Getting Started

To execute this project it is necessary to have the .NET Core SDK installed in version 3.1 (type ** dotnet --version ** in the Windows console)<br>
You will need an installation of Visual Studio 2019 (community) and must have a local server installation of Sql Server 2017.

# Build and Test

To build the code, just load the project in Visual Studio.<br>
Because it is a small project, there was no need to include tests (but I confess that I was tempted)
